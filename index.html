                <p>Here, is an image of the demon slayer character Uzui Who defeated the upper rank demon gyutaro and daki.</p>
                <p>At Episode 10 we saw that uzui is struggling as his body is poissoned from gyutaro's blade and his arm is cut off uzui the little strategy master has forced his heart to stop and is waiting for tanjiro to make his move for an opening. </p>
                <p>when tanjiro said "this is the part is was waiting for.." and headbutts gyutaro , gyutaro is unable to regenerate because he has a kunai stuck to his leg, tanjiro then uses his sun breathing form(hinokami kagura) and tries to decapitate gyutaro but he removes the kunai and regenerates quickly. </p>
                <p>tanjiro and gyutaro then fight for a while and while he was exhausted, gyutaro was aiming at tanjiro's eyes (gyutaro was faster than tanjiro). suddenly uzui appears saving tanjiro which his blade (remeber that uzui has only one arm) he is using his one arm and his shoulder blades to control his swords, then afterwards there is an intense fight between gyutaro and uzui, tanjiro appereciating uzui simultaeneously running towards the battle field.</p>
